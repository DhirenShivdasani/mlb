## Overview

The DFS Odds Comparison Extension and React Web Application are powerful tools designed to enhance your Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) experience by providing real-time odds comparisons from various sportsbooks. These tools seamlessly integrate into popular DFS platforms, enabling users to make informed decisions by comparing odds for player props directly within the DFS interface and through a comprehensive web application.

## Features

- **Real-time Odds Comparison:** Instantly compare odds from multiple sportsbooks for player props (Total Bases, Runs, Strikeouts, Points, Assists, Rebounds, and 3-Pointers Made), ensuring you get the best value for your bets.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The extension adds a simple and intuitive icon next to each player prop. Hovering over the icon reveals detailed odds information in a tooltip.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Supports integration with both Underdog Fantasy and PrizePicks, providing a versatile tool for DFS enthusiasts.
- **Automated Updates:** The extension and web application automatically update odds data every few minutes, ensuring you always have the most current information.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Access historical odds data to identify trends and make informed betting decisions.
- **Interactive Filtering and Sorting:** Easily filter and sort player props by player name, game, prop type, and implied probability.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## How It Works

Once the extension is installed and activated, it adds an informational icon next to each player prop listed on the DFS platform. Users can hover over the icon to view a detailed breakdown of the odds from different sportsbooks. This breakdown includes odds for various betting options like "Higher" and "Lower," allowing users to quickly compare and make informed decisions.

The web application retrieves odds data from the backend and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can interact with the data by applying filters, sorting, and viewing detailed historical data through a modal chart.
